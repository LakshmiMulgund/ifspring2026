            <h3> [Verse 1] </h3>
                <p>
                    All it'd take is one flight <br>
                    We'd be in the same time zone <br>
                    Looking through your timeline <br>
                    Seeing all the rainbows, I <br>
                    I got an idea <br>
                    And I know that it sounds crazy <br>
                    I just wanna see ya <br>
                    All I gotta ask <br>
                </p>

                <h3> [Chorus] </h3>
                <p>
                    Do you got plans tonight? <br>
                    I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I <br>
                    I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight <br>
                    'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind <br>
                Can't get you off my mind <br>
                Can't get you off my mind (Uh) <br>

                <h3> [Verse 2] </h3>
                <p>
                I could feel the tension <br>
                We could cut it with a knife <br>
                I know it's more than just a friendship <br>
                I can hear you think I'm right, yeah <br>
                Do I gotta convince you <br>
                That you shouldn't fall asleep? <br>
                It'll only be a couple hours <br>
                And I'm about to leave <br>
                </p>
