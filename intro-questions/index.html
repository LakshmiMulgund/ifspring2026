        <li>Lakshmi Mulgund, junior majoring in Communication Design & FMS.</li>

        <li>In Type 1, we did limited HTML/CSS, but I really enjoyed learning about it and wanted to expand my knowledge. 
            I also think it's really helpful going forward considering the time we live in. </li>

        <li>I have briefly used VS Code in Typography 1, but I was mostly using it to learn about creating margins, headers, footers. 
            Very simple text related coding. </li>

        <li>I want to learn how to create a working accessible website! 
            Ultimately, I would love to learn how to apply this to my own portfolio and client gallery sites for my freelance work. </li>

        <li>With designing for the screen, you aren't directly changing the scene and seeing the changes real time.
            You make changes, then save it, and hope it looks the way you do. 
            It will definitely be different than designing in Photoshop where you can see the changes immediately, as you make them.</li>

        <li>I find a lot of effective design tools being utilized here. 
            It’s very dynamic to scroll through and provides a color palette fitting to the industry (startup). 
            I really like the interactivity on the scroll, and I found out that the home page changes images and color by day.

        <li>I love the simplicity in the duolingo website. It explains its main goal as soon as you open the page, 
            but you immediately get a sense for the brand and also the point of the website / app as you continuing scroll through the homepage.

        <li>This may be niche to a design standpoint but I find texture labs to be a website that works well!
            I always stumble on websites that claim to have free assets and this one truly does that are clean, 
            easy to search through, and what you find is what you get.
