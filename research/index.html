        <h4> Description </h4>
             <p>With its super-moist and buttery texture, banana and brown sugar flavors, soft crumb, and 1,000+ reviews, this is a delicious AND undeniably popular banana bread recipe. You need 4 large ripe bananas. This recipe is also in my cookbook, Sally’s Baking 101.</p>

        <h4> Ingredients </h4>
            <p> 
            2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled) <br>
            1 teaspoon baking soda <br>
            1/4 teaspoon salt <br>
            1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br>
            1/2 cup (8 Tbsp; 113g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature <br>
            3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar <br>
            2 large eggs, at room temperature <br>
            1/3 cup (80g) plain Greek yogurt or full-fat sour cream, at room temperature <br>
            1 and 1/2 cups (345g) mashed bananas (about 3–4 ripe bananas) <br>
            1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract <br>
            optional: 3/4 cup (90g) chopped pecans or walnuts, or 1 cup (180g) semi-sweet chocolate chips <br>  
            </p>

        <h4> Directions </h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Lowering the oven rack prevents the top of your bread from browning too much, too soon. Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray. Set aside.</li>
                <li> In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together. Set aside.</li>
                <li> In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and brown sugar together on medium-high speed until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. (Here’s a helpful tutorial if you need guidance on how to cream butter and sugar.) With the mixer running on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the yogurt, vanilla, and mashed bananas until combined. </li>
                <li> Add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients and beat on low speed just until combined. Do not over-mix. Fold in the nuts/chocolate chips, if using. The batter should be thick. </li>
                <li> Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the pan with aluminum foil halfway through, to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. Cool the bread in the pan set on a cooling rack for 1 hour. Remove the bread from the pan and cool it directly on the rack until ready to slice and serve. </li>
                <li> Store wrapped tightly at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. </li>
            </ol>

                    This is the site / recipe I've been using for the last 6-7 years! I even had my mom send me the recipe today just to make sure I had it for this project. And very honestly, I made the recipe today as well haha - so I know the steps and ingredients are correct in precision and taste.

                    As a baker, I've made a ton of recipes before, and a huge number have stemmed from here.  They have a 4.7 star rating with 13,589 reviews on just banana bread alone which seems prety reliable for proving the site is good and well trusted.

                    The NY Times is a reputable source of information not only for cooking, but general jouranalism as well. Their viewership alone along with their reputation makes this a pretty trustworthy site to get recipes from.

                    I really like the clean lines, minimalist design applied here. This also might be silly but I really like how they do their dropdown menu with the icons. I think that could be interesting to try and implement.

                    I really like the margins and the choice of fonts, and I like the white space in the images as well. In their shop they have buttons to navigate different filters which I think is a nice clean tool.

                    Admittedly this is a friend's portfolio but I really enjoy the way she uses the pop ups and how the images are framed and are presented in unique angles. There's something super intentional about her use of color and shadows which I really like.
